# ABOUT: This is a config for submitting 1 sample, 2 sets of single-end reads, an assembly and bins.
# ABOUT: Coverage is derived from one unsorted .bam file.
# ABOUT: Taxonomy is derived from `gtdb_to_ncbi_majority_vote.py` output
# USAGE: navigate to the <examples> directory
# USAGE: submg submit --config 02_samples_reads_assembly_bins.yaml --staging_dir <path/to/staging/dir> --logging_dir <path/to/logging/dir> --submit_samples --submit_reads --submit_assembly --submit_bins
