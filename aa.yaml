STUDY:                                              # The accession of your study (which has to already exist in ENA). >>EXAMPLE: "PRJEB71644"
METAGENOME_SCIENTIFIC_NAME:                         # Taxonomic identifier of the metagenome. Check the ENA metagenome taxonomy tree to find a taxonomy ID and species name fitting your sample. >>EXAMPLE: "biogas fermenter metagenome"
METAGENOME_TAXID:                                   # Taxonomic identifier of the assembly. Must match SPECIES_SCIENTIFIC_NAME. >>EXAMPLE: "718289"
NEW_SAMPLES:                                        # These samples will be created in ENA according to the data entered below. Your assembly MUST BE BASED ON ALL OF THESE.
- TITLE:                                            # A unique title for your sample. >>EXAMPLE: "Bioreactor_2_sample"
  collection date:                                  # Any ISO compliant time. Can be truncated from the right (e.g. '2023-12-27T16:07' or '2023-12'). >>EXAMPLE: "2023-03"
  geographic location (country and/or sea):         # See ENA checklists (e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERC000011) for valid values. >>EXAMPLE: "Germany"
  ADDITIONAL_SAMPLESHEET_FIELDS:                    # You can add any additional fields of metadata to the samplesheet. They are recorded as pairs of keyword and value. There are no restrictions on what data can go in here. Use commas to separate list items. It is recommended to check the ENA samplesheet which most closely matches your data to see recommended fields.
